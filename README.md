### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hugo, and I'm a curious and passionate student studying Software Engineering at the University of Sydney. I started coding because I enjoyed the problem solving, but when I realised I could build things to help make my life easier, I couldn't wait to try and build them.

You can find out more about me on my [website](https://hugojjohnson.github.io/). See you there!
